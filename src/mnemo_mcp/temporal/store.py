"""Phase 3 KG-store helper: wire extract output into memory_edges with memory_id.

Phase 1 ``server._enrich_memory`` calls ``graph.upsert_entities`` +
``graph.create_relations`` + ``graph.link_memory_entities`` to persist the
LLM-extracted KG fragment, but the ``memory_edges`` rows it writes do NOT
record which capture they came from. Phase 3 adds bitemporal columns
(``memory_id`` / ``valid_from`` / ``valid_to``) to ``memory_edges`` so
edges can be traced back to a specific capture and aged out via
supersession.

This module provides :func:`store_kg_with_memory_id` which extends the
Phase 1 wiring with three Phase 3 enhancements:

1. Backfills ``memory_edges.memory_id`` to the originating capture id so
   the audit / supersession path can target relation rows by source.
2. Initialises ``memory_edges.valid_from`` to capture time and leaves
   ``valid_to`` NULL (currently valid).
3. Returns counts ``{"entities": N, "edges": M, "links": L}`` so the
   caller (server enrichment + future ``knowledge-audit`` action) can
   report the KG growth without a follow-up query.

The legacy ``graph`` helpers stay untouched so existing tests keep
passing; this module composes them then patches the extra columns
in-place via a single UPDATE.
