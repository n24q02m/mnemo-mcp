"""Zero-env-config relay setup flow.

When no env vars are set, this module resolves config from the encrypted
config file or triggers the relay page setup to collect credentials from the
user via a browser-based form.

For mnemo-mcp, relay is optional -- local mode works without any config.
Cloud mode credentials (API_KEYS) are resolved via relay when not set in env.
